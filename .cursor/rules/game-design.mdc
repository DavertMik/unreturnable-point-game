# Game Rules

Infection is a terraporph game where terrain gets infected and expands to destroy player's base. Player can cut terrain as in minecraft. Infected terrain starts with infected egg (spawner). After egg is placed, it starts spreading randomly on different axes (random function params: speed, direction). When egg is destroyed player gets scrore and infected terrain slowly disappears. If all eggs are destroyed - player(s) win. If infected terrain reaches bunker players lose.

## Bunker

- The bunker is an breakable platform where the player spawns (has a bed).
- The bunker is initially a 5x5 block platform, centered at (0,0,0), at y=0.
- Size of Bunker 3x3

## Wilderness
- The wilderness is a 50x50 block area made of clay blocks, centered at (0,0,0), at y=0.
- The wilderness is flat by default but will be transformed over time.
- Zombies randomly spawn across the wilderness.
- The wilderness can be terraformed in real time (10s delay). Example: a point 5 blocks above ground is chosen, and 10x10 blocks below grow towards it every 10s until the point is reached. Then a new point is chosen and the process repeats.

## Player
- The player spawns in the bunker.

## Map

- The bunker and wilderness are stored as separate map files and merged at game start, so the bunker can be edited independently.
